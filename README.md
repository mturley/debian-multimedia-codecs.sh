debian-multimedia-codecs.sh: github's smallest useful repository
================================================================

Scripts to install community and 3rd-party audio and video codecs on Debian GNU/Linux.

Run:

    $ sudo ./install_64.sh

or:

    $ sudo ./install_32.sh

That's it!

*Fun fact: there are more lines in this readme than in the scripts themselves*
